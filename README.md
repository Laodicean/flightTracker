### How do I run this System ###

In order to properly run this command, you'll need to know the location of a file that contians any querys that need to be searched for,
as well as a file containing the flights that need to be entered into the graph.

In order to run the system, go to the folder labelled "src"
and run the command: 

./travelplan <File with the flight data> <File with the query data>
